# Distributed Systems and Fault Tolerance

## Course Overview
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to fault-tolerant distributed systems. Students will explore the fundamental principles, theoretical models, and practical implementations of distributed computing, with a strong emphasis on ensuring system reliability and robustness in the presence of failures.

Through a mix of theoretical concepts and hands-on exercises, students will gain insight into the challenges of distributed consensus, data consistency, and fault tolerance. The course covers key algorithms, protocols, and architectures that enable modern distributed systems to operate efficiently and reliably.

## Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to Fault-Tolerant Distributed Systems**  
   - Characteristics of distributed systems  
   - Types of failures and their implications  
   - Fault tolerance strategies  

2. **Theoretical Foundations**  
   - The CAP theorem: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance  
   - Distributed consensus and coordination  
   - Models of consistency in distributed databases  

3. **Consensus Protocols**  
   - Raft: A leader-based consensus algorithm  
   - Paxos and its variations  
   - Practical applications of consensus algorithms  

4. **Fault Tolerance in Cloud and Distributed Storage**  
   - Replication techniques  
   - Eventual consistency models  
   - High availability strategies  

5. **Blockchain and Fault-Tolerant Architectures**  
   - Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT)  
   - Consensus mechanisms in blockchain (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, etc.)  
   - Smart contracts and decentralized applications  

6. **Recovery and Resilience**  
   - Failure detection and self-healing systems  
   - Checkpointing and rollback mechanisms  
   - Design patterns for building resilient distributed systems  

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will:
- Understand the fundamental challenges and trade-offs in distributed computing.
- Analyze different fault tolerance mechanisms and their real-world applications.
- Implement consensus algorithms and evaluate their performance in various scenarios.
- Design and deploy distributed applications with resilience and high availability.
- Explore the role of blockchain in ensuring fault tolerance in decentralized environments.

## Prerequisites
This course assumes familiarity with basic networking concepts, operating systems, and programming experience in Python or a similar language. Prior knowledge of distributed systems is helpful but not required.

## Course Format
The course consists of a combination of lectures, interactive discussions, coding assignments, and hands-on labs to reinforce theoretical concepts. Students will also work on a final project, applying the principles learned to build a fault-tolerant distributed application.
